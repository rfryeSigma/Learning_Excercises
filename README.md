remains the bible for everything about quantum computing and information.

It contains exercises and problem sets.

contains my `Jupyter` notebooks for exercises related to chapters of
```
    Hands-On Quantum Machine Learning With Python
    Volume 1: Get Started by Dr. Frank Zickert
    Copyright © 2021 Dr. Frank Zickert, pyqml.com
```
The book is an outgrowth of Zickert's informative blog at
[https://pyqml.medium.com/](https://pyqml.medium.com/)

The second volume has been published, but I have not read it yet.

## Jack Hidary
The book
```
Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach
By Jack D. Hidary
Springer Nature

```
gives a thorough treatment and contains examples in
- `Cirq` Google’s quantum computing development library
- `Qiskit` IBM's Quantum Information Science Kit written in `Qiskit` and `OpenQASM`, 
- `Forest` Rigetti's development library written in `Quil` and `pyQuil`,
- `QDK` Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit written in `Q#`.

I have used the examples to experiment with `Cirq`.

The book

Programming Quantum Computers
Essential Algorithms and Code Samples

simplifies examples by avoiding complex numbers and restricting to the real plane of the Bloch sphere.

The companion web site [https://oreilly-qc.github.io/](https://oreilly-qc.github.io/)
allows running of all of the code samples in a very useful interpretive environment
called `QCEngine` and coversion of the code to `Qiskit`, `OpenQASM`, `Q#`, or `Cirq`.

I used the site extensively to experiment with my own scripts.
