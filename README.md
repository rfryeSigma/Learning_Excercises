Notes about and quantum computing books and tutorials
including code for exercises

## Ike & Mike
The encyclopedic book
```
Quantum Computation and Quantum Information
Michael A. Nielsen & Isaac L. Chuang
CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS
First published 2000
Reprinted 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2009
10th Anniversary edition published 2010
```
remains the bible for everything about quantum computing and information.

It contains exercises and problem sets.

## Frank Zickert
Folder
`
Frank_Zickert_Hands-On Quantum Machine Learning With Python
`

contains my `Jupyter` notebooks for exercises related to chapters of
```
    Hands-On Quantum Machine Learning With Python
    Volume 1: Get Started by Dr. Frank Zickert
    Copyright © 2021 Dr. Frank Zickert, pyqml.com
```
The book is an outgrowth of Zickert's informative blog at
[https://pyqml.medium.com/](https://pyqml.medium.com/)

The second volume has been published, but I have not read it yet.
```
Hands-On Quantum Machine Learning With Python Volume 2: Combinatorial Optimization
```

## Jack Hidary
The book
```
Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach
By Jack D. Hidary
Springer Nature
Second edition, 2021
```
gives a thorough treatment and contains examples in
- `Cirq` Google’s quantum computing development library
- `Qiskit` IBM's Quantum Information Science Kit written in `Qiskit` and `OpenQASM`, 
- `Forest` Rigetti's development library written in `Quil` and `pyQuil`,
- `QDK` Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit written in `Q#`.

The companion website
[https://github.com/jackhidary/quantumcomputingbook](https://github.com/jackhidary/quantumcomputingbook)
gives supporting information, problem sets, and sample code.

I have used the examples to experiment with `Cirq`.

## O'Reilly
The book
```
Programming Quantum Computers
Essential Algorithms and Code Samples
by Eric R. Johnston, Nic Harrigan, and Mercedes Gimeno-Segovia
Copyright © 2019 Eric R. Johnston, Nic Harrigan, and Mercedes Gimeno-Segovia.
Published by O’Reilly Media, Inc.,
```
simplifies examples by avoiding complex numbers and restricting to the real plane of the Bloch sphere.

The companion web site [https://oreilly-qc.github.io/](https://oreilly-qc.github.io/)
allows running of all of the code samples in a very useful interpretive environment
called `QCEngine` and coversion of the code to `Qiskit`, `OpenQASM`, `Q#`, or `Cirq`.

I used the site extensively to experiment with my own scripts.

## IBM Quantum
IBM offers free access to simulators and several 5 and 7 qubit computers with superb documentation.

IBM Composer lets you drag-and-drop circuit components or manipulate OpenQASM code and see the effect of running a circuit. It is an excellent tool for experimentation.

IBM Quantum Lab lets you develop and run `Jupyter` notebooks for running on simulators or IBM quantum computers.

Compute Resources shows the status of IBM quantum computers including qubit layout and performance at last calibration.

## MITRE Tutorial
The MITRE course tutorial at
[https://stem.mitre.org/quantum/quantum-concepts/qubits.html](https://stem.mitre.org/quantum/quantum-concepts/qubits.html]
offers clear explanations of quantum concepts and access to the `Quirk` webapp for graphically constructing and simulating quantum circuits.

## Other Useful Books
The book
```
Quantum Computing
by Mika Hirvensalo
Springer Verlag, 2001
```
covers the usual quantum algorithms from a more mathematical perspective.


The book
```
Numerical Recipes in Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computing
An Adventure in FORTRAN 90
by M. S. Ramkarthik and Payal D. Solanki
CRC Press, 2022
```
gives `FORTRAN 90` code for simulating quantum components and algorithms.
